# Naveenkumar - Portfolio




This is the code repository for my personal portfolio, which showcases my projects and skills as a full-stack developer specialising in the MERN stack. 
This project uses MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to deliver a dynamic and responsive web application.


## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Project Listing:** Projects are stored in a MongoDB database and rendered on the website dynamically.
- **Contact Form:** Integrated a Node.js backend with Express to handle form submissions securely.
- **Admin Panel:** A simple admin panel to manage project displays and inquiries received through the website.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** For storing and retrieving data related to projects and inquiries.
- **Express.js:** The backend framework handles requests and responses between the front end and the server.
- **React.js:** The frontend library is used to build the user interface.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment to help run JavaScript on the server.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling.
